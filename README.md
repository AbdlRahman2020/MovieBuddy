## Algorithm
##### Content Based Recommendations (Recommender Algorithm)
* To build our model, we created a count matrix that is created by the hlp of a count vectorizer.
* We used cosine similarity from scikit-learn to determine how similar the movies are, regardless of the size.
* After building the cosine similarity matrix for our dataset, we can now sort the results to find out the top 10 similar movies.
* We return the movie title & indexes to the user.
